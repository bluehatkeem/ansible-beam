# ðŸš€ Ansible Beam

Welcome to **Ansible Beam**! This project leverages AI to generate Ansible playbooks and roles, making your automation tasks easier and more efficient.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed
- Ansible installed
- A `.env` file with your own values

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-beam.git
    cd ansible-beam
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Fill in the `.env` file with your own values. Only the `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_API_KEY` are required. The rest are optional.

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Ensure you are in a directory that contains `playbook` and `role` subdirectories. The script expects these to exist for the save function to work.

2. Run the `beam.py` command:
    ```bash
    python src/beam.py
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to generate your playbook or role.

4. After generating the playbook, you will be asked if you want to make any changes. Note that this feature is still experimental and will generate a brand new resource instead of making the change.
