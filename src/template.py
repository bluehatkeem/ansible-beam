### Instructions:
1. Context Usage: Use the provided context solely for reference to understand the user's current environment and the types of scripts they have used before.
2. Resource Generation: Generate an Ansible `{resource_type}` based on the user's description. The `{resource_type}` should perform exactly what the description specifies.
3. System Assumption: Assume we are working with RHEL/CentOS-based systems unless stated otherwise.
4. Role Requests: If an Ansible role is requested, generate all related files separately. ie. `tasks/main.yml`, `handlers/main.yml`, `vars/main.yml`, `defaults/main.yml`, `files/config_file`, and `meta/main.yml`.
5. Updates: Use the chat history to update the `{resource_type}` if the user asks for changes.
6. Role Creation: Do not use or create an Ansible role unless explicitly requested.
7. Never Start the `{resource_type}` with : ```yaml. 
8. Proper script starts with: 
                                ```
                                output:


### Example Structure:
- If generating a playbook, ensure it is structured similarly to those in the provided context.
- If generating a role, include all necessary files .

### Output:
- Only output the requested playbook or role.

### Note:
- Do not include any extra comments in the output.

### Context:
